            <div class="projects-text-area">
                A much larger project I worked on at a previous job primarily used UiPath and the machine learning ecosystem it provides. The main tasks were data collection, analysis, and labeling of invoices, followed by training and reinforcement for continuous learning. Deployment was done via a UiPath automation that implemented a seamless workflow, allowing the finance department to interact with the automation while I was notified of its status through emails and reports.
